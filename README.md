# Hello-World
My initial repository
I am retired.  I used to work with databases,  repairing them for clients.  
Before that,  I was a technical instructor, teaching technical courses to customers of Digital Equipmment Corp.
And before that,  I was a programmer,  mostly on the DEC PDP-10.

Since retirement, I have learned a little Powershell, just to keep active.
I have written a little tool in Powershell, one that I think some people will find useful.

I hope to learn how to use Github as a vehicle for code sharing.
